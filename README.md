# Malaria_Detection

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

Download the dataset from kaggle and place it in your working directory.

Use the Malaria detection MobileV2 file to train your CNN model and to save it.

After training use Prediction.ipynb file to predict the test image dataset.

The model is trained on MobilenetV2 using weights of imagenet. 
You can also use ResNet50 or VGG16 or VGG19 in the same notebook. Just load them tensorflow.keras.applications module.
